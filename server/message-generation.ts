1. Five Love Languages (Dr. Gary Chapman):
   - Words of Affirmation: Verbal expressions of love, appreciation, and encouragement
   - Quality Time: Undivided attention and meaningful shared experiences
   - Physical Touch: Appropriate physical contact that communicates love and security
   - Acts of Service: Helpful actions that demonstrate care and support
   - Receiving Gifts: Thoughtful gifts as symbols of love and consideration

2. Personality Psychology Principles:
   - Nurturing Connectors respond to warm, emotionally expressive communication
   - Devoted Caregivers appreciate acknowledgment of their service-oriented nature
   - Thoughtful Analysts value intellectual depth and meaningful conversations
   - Practical Partners prefer straightforward, solution-focused communication
   - Independent Achievers appreciate encouraging, goal-oriented messages
   - Adventure Companions love energetic, spontaneous, fun communication
   - Selective Intimates value private, deep, emotionally selective expressions
   - Loyal Supporters respond to steady, supportive encouragement

3. Attachment Theory Insights:
   - Messages should create secure emotional connections
   - Balance between independence and togetherness
   - Consistent emotional availability and responsiveness
   - Validation of feelings and experiences

Generate messages that integrate these frameworks naturally, making the partner feel understood, valued, and emotionally connected. Messages should sound authentic and personal, not clinical or theoretical. Respond with JSON only.`

Category Purpose: ${categoryInfo.description}

Psychological Framework Guidelines for ${categoryInfo.label}:
${getCategoryGuidelines(category)}

Core Requirements:
- Generate exactly 3 unique messages that integrate psychological principles naturally
- Apply Five Love Languages framework: Consider how different love languages (Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Physical Touch, Acts of Service, Receiving Gifts) would resonate with this personality type
- Match the ${personalityType} personality type's communication style, values, and preferences
- Create secure attachment through consistent emotional availability and validation
- Make messages feel authentic, warm, and personal - never clinical or overly theoretical
- Vary the tone, approach, and love language emphasis across the 3 messages
- Keep messages concise (1-3 sentences) but emotionally meaningful
- Use the partner's name naturally when it enhances connection
- Ensure each message would make the partner feel truly understood and valued

Message Crafting Strategy:
1. First message: Lead with their primary personality strength/value
2. Second message: Integrate a different love language or emotional need
3. Third message: Combine elements for deeper connection
